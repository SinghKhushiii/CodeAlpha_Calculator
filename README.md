# CodeAlpha_Calculator
A responsive and modern calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my internship project. It performs basic arithmetic operations (+, –, ×, ÷, %, etc.) and features a clean UI with neumorphic design. Demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and front-end development skills.
